# Mage 2 Katas

A Magento 2 installation, tailored for facilitating specific kata-based tasks.

## Philosophy

This repo is intended to be forked and used for your own personal development Magento 2 common dev tasks.

The idea is that you can practice certain common tasks, over and over until they become muscle memory.

Some uses:

- Interview prep
- Magento skills development
- Certification training

## Getting Started

Coming soon...

The idea is that you can run a simple `docker-compose up -d` in the root of the repository on any system and start a kata immediately.

## Contributing

We will create a Contributing.md file soon. Please feel free to PR prior to that however!
